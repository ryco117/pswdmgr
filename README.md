pswdmgr-gui
===========
This is a Qt wrapper of pswdmgr, a very lightweight password manager utility to make use of the experimental library CryptoLibrary.
All website credentials are written to disk in an AES-256 encrypted file with a random IV and a 256-bit key.
The key is generated by hashing your password with scrypt (with a high difficulty [work=1048576, ram=8, cpu=1]) and a random salt (to ensure same password never maps to the same key twice).
